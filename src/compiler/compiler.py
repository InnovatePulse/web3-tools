           : Blockchain -> GET, SET
1. **Syntax**:
   - **Grammar**: Rules that define the structure of valid statements and expressions.
   - **Keywords**: Reserved words with special meaning (e.g., `if`, `while`, `return`).

2. **Semantics**:
   - **Static Semantics**: Rules that govern the meaning of syntactically valid statements (e.g., type checking).
   - **Dynamic Semantics**: The behavior of programs when they are executed.

3. **Data Types**:
   - **Primitive Types**: Basic data types (e.g., integers, floats, booleans).
   - **Composite Types**: Complex data types (e.g., arrays, structs, objects).

4. **Variables**:
   - **Declarations**: Statements that introduce variables and their types.
   - **Scope**: The context in which a variable is valid and accessible.

5. **Control Structures**:
   - **Conditionals**: Statements that perform different actions based on conditions (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`).
   - **Loops**: Statements that repeat actions (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do-while`).

6. **Functions/Procedures**:
   - **Definition**: Blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called multiple times.
   - **Parameters**: Inputs to functions.
   - **Return Values**: Outputs from functions.

7. **Operators and Expressions**:
   - **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform mathematical operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
   - **Logical Operators**: Perform logical operations (e.g., `&&`, `||`, `!`).

8. **Standard Library**:
   - **Utility Functions**: Predefined functions that facilitate common tasks (e.g., string manipulation, file I/O).

9. **Input/Output**:
   - **Input**: Mechanisms for obtaining data from the user or other sources.
   - **Output**: Mechanisms for displaying or storing data.

10. **Error Handling**:
    - **Exceptions**: Mechanisms for managing errors and exceptional conditions.
    - **Debugging Tools**: Tools and features for diagnosing and fixing issues.

11. **Memory Management**:
    - **Allocation**: Assigning memory to variables and data structures.
    - **Deallocation**: Releasing memory that is no longer needed.
    - **Garbage Collection**: Automatic management of memory deallocation (in some languages).

12. **Compilation/Interpretation**:
    - **Compiler**: Translates code into machine language (e.g., C, C++).
    - **Interpreter**: Executes code line by line (e.g., Python).

13. **Concurrency**:
    - **Threads**: Units of execution within a program.
    - **Synchronization**: Mechanisms to control the execution of concurrent processes.

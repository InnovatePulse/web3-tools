I understand what you're aiming for. We can achieve this by creating a more abstract and extensible VM that can dynamically interpret and execute tasks defined in JSON smart contracts without needing to modify the VM code for each new functionality. This can be done by using a registry of operations that the VM can reference when executing actions.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Define a Registry of Operations**: The VM will use a registry to map action names to their corresponding operations.
2. **Abstract OISC Class**: The class will include methods for registering operations and executing actions.
3. **JSON Smart Contracts**: Actions in the smart contracts will be interpreted by the VM using the registry.

### 1. Define a Registry of Operations
We will create a global registry that maps action names to their corresponding functions.

### 2. Abstract OISC Class

```python
class OISC:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = [0] * 100
        self.registers = {'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0}
        self.state = {
            'students': {},
            'courses': {},
            'proposals': {},
            'nfts': {}
        }
        self.operations = {}

    def register_operation(self, action_name, function):
        self.operations[action_name] = function

    def execute(self, instruction):
        action = instruction.get('action')
        if action in self.operations:
            self.operations[action](self, instruction)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown action: {action}")

    def execute_smart_contract(self, actions):
        for instruction in actions:
            self.execute(instruction)
```

### 3. Register Operations for DAO University

We'll define functions for each operation and register them with the VM.

```python
def register_student(vm, instruction):
    student = instruction['student']
    vm.state['students'][student['id']] = student
    print(f"Registered student: {student}")

def add_course(vm, instruction):
    course = instruction['course']
    vm.state['courses'][course['id']] = course
    print(f"Added course: {course}")

def vote_proposal(vm, instruction):
    proposal = instruction['proposal']
    proposals = vm.state['proposals']
    if proposal['id'] in proposals:
        proposals[proposal['id']]['votes'] += 1
    else:
        proposals[proposal['id']] = proposal
        proposals[proposal['id']]['votes'] = 1
    print(f"Voted on proposal: {proposal}")

def generate_nft(vm, instruction):
    nft = instruction['nft']
    vm.state['nfts'][nft['id']] = nft
    print(f"Generated NFT: {nft}")

# Instantiate the VM
vm = OISC()

# Register operations
vm.register_operation('register_student', register_student)
vm.register_operation('add_course', add_course)
vm.register_operation('vote_proposal', vote_proposal)
vm.register_operation('generate_nft', generate_nft)

# Define JSON smart contracts
smart_contracts = [
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "register_student",
                "student": {
                    "id": "S001",
                    "name": "John Doe",
                    "department": "Computer Science"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "add_course",
                "course": {
                    "id": "C001",
                    "name": "Blockchain Technology",
                    "department": "Computer Science"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "vote_proposal",
                "proposal": {
                    "id": "P001",
                    "description": "Increase Research Funding"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "generate_nft",
                "nft": {
                    "id": "NFT001",
                    "name": "RareArt",
                    "metadata": {
                        "artist": "Alice",
                        "creation_date": "2024-11-23",
                        "description": "A rare piece of digital art."
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]

# Execute the smart contracts
for contract in smart_contracts:
    vm.execute_smart_contract(contract['actions'])

# Print the VM state to see the changes
print(vm.state)
```

### Explanation
1. **Abstract OISC Class**: The class includes a `register_operation` method to add operations dynamically and an `execute` method to perform operations based on the action.
2. **Registry of Operations**: Functions corresponding to each operation are defined separately and registered with the VM.
3. **Self-Contained JSON Contracts**: The smart contracts specify actions which the VM executes using the registered operations.

This design ensures that you can add new functionality by simply defining new JSON smart contracts and registering the corresponding operations without modifying the core VM code. If you have more specific requirements or need further customization, feel free to ask!

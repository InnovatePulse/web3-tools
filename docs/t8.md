Great! Let's extend the implementation to include the following steps:
1. **Generate JWT Blocks** for the functions and smart contracts.
2. **Distribute JWT Blocks using Torrent**.
3. **Implement Proof of Work** for consensus using nonce and mining.

### Step 1: Generate JWT Blocks

We already have the `BlockchainJWT` class to create and decode JWTs. We'll use this class to generate JWT blocks for the smart contracts.

### Step 2: Distribute JWT Blocks using Torrent

We can use the `libtorrent` library to create and distribute torrent files for the JWT blocks.

### Step 3: Implement Proof of Work

Proof of Work (PoW) involves finding a nonce such that the hash of the block with the nonce meets a difficulty target. We'll include a simple PoW implementation.

### Complete Implementation

#### 1. Generate JWT Blocks for Functions and Smart Contracts

We'll update the code to create JWT blocks for the smart contracts and include them in a blockchain.

```python
import hashlib
import json
import jwt
import datetime
import libtorrent as lt
import time

class BlockchainJWT:
    def __init__(self, secret_key):
        self.secret_key = secret_key

    def create_jwt(self, prev_hash, transaction_data, nonce=0):
        payload = {
            'prev_hash': prev_hash,
            'timestamp': datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'transaction_data': transaction_data,
            'nonce': nonce
        }
        token = jwt.encode(payload, self.secret_key, algorithm='HS256')
        return token

    def decode_jwt(self, token):
        try:
            payload = jwt.decode(token, self.secret_key, algorithms=['HS256'])
            return payload
        except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
            return "Token has expired"
        except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
            return "Invalid token"

# Proof of Work Implementation
def proof_of_work(blockchain_jwt, prev_hash, transaction_data, difficulty):
    nonce = 0
    while True:
        token = blockchain_jwt.create_jwt(prev_hash, transaction_data, nonce)
        hash_result = hashlib.sha256(token.encode()).hexdigest()
        if hash_result[:difficulty] == '0' * difficulty:
            return token, nonce, hash_result
        nonce += 1

# Example JSON smart contracts
smart_contracts = [
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "register_student",
                "student": {
                    "id": "S001",
                    "name": "John Doe",
                    "department": "Computer Science"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "add_course",
                "course": {
                    "id": "C001",
                    "name": "Blockchain Technology",
                    "department": "Computer Science"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "vote_proposal",
                "proposal": {
                    "id": "P001",
                    "description": "Increase Research Funding"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "actions": [
            {
                "action": "generate_nft",
                "nft": {
                    "id": "NFT001",
                    "name": "RareArt",
                    "metadata": {
                        "artist": "Alice",
                        "creation_date": "2024-11-23",
                        "description": "A rare piece of digital art."
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
]

# Instantiate BlockchainJWT
secret_key = 'your-secret-key'
blockchain_jwt = BlockchainJWT(secret_key)

# Create the initial block
prev_hash = '0' * 64
difficulty = 2  # Adjust difficulty as needed
blocks = []

for contract in smart_contracts:
    token, nonce, hash_result = proof_of_work(blockchain_jwt, prev_hash, contract, difficulty)
    print(f"Generated Block with Nonce: {nonce}, Hash: {hash_result}")
    blocks.append(token)
    prev_hash = hash_result

# Save JWT blocks to file
with open('blocks.txt', 'w') as file:
    for block in blocks:
        file.write(f"{block}\n")
```

#### 2. Distribute JWT Blocks Using Torrent

We'll create a torrent file for the `blocks.txt` file.

```python
def create_torrent(file_path, torrent_path):
    fs = lt.file_storage()
    lt.add_files(fs, file_path)

    t = lt.create_torrent(fs)
    t.add_tracker("udp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce")
    t.add_tracker("udp://tracker.opentrackr.org:1337/announce")

    lt.set_piece_hashes(t, ".")
    torrent = t.generate()

    with open(torrent_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(lt.bencode(torrent))

    print(f'Torrent file created at {torrent_path}')

# Example usage
file_path = "blocks.txt"
torrent_path = "blocks.torrent"
create_torrent(file_path, torrent_path)
```

#### 3. Download and Execute JWT Blocks on the VM

We'll download the JWT blocks, decode them, and execute the instructions on the VM.

```python
def download_torrent(torrent_path, save_path):
    ses = lt.session()
    ses.listen_on(6881, 6891)
    info = lt.torrent_info(torrent_path)
    h = ses.add_torrent({'ti': info, 'save_path': save_path})
    print('Downloading:', h.name())
    while not h.is_seed():
        s = h.status()
        print(f'Downloading... {s.progress * 100:.2f}% complete (down: {s.download_rate / 1000:.2f} kB/s, up: {s.upload_rate / 1000:.2f} kB/s, peers: {s.num_peers})')
        time.sleep(1)
    print('Download complete')

# Download blocks via torrent
torrent_path = "blocks.torrent"
save_path = "./"
download_torrent(torrent_path, save_path)

# Load and decode blocks
with open('blocks.txt', 'r') as file:
    blocks = file.readlines()

# Register operations for the VM
vm = OISC()
vm.register_operation('register_student', register_student)
vm.register_operation('add_course', add_course)
vm.register_operation('vote_proposal', vote_proposal)
vm.register_operation('generate_nft', generate_nft)

# Execute the blocks on the VM
for block in blocks:
    decoded_payload = blockchain_jwt.decode_jwt(block.strip())
    if 'transaction_data' in decoded_payload and 'contract' in decoded_payload['transaction_data']:
        contract = decoded_payload['transaction_data']['contract']
        vm.execute_smart_contract(contract['actions'])

# Print the VM state to see the changes
print(vm.state)
```

### Explanation

1. **JWT Blocks**: Generate JWT blocks for the smart contracts, including nonce for proof of work.
2. **Torrent Creation**: Create a torrent file to distribute the `blocks.txt` file.
3. **Proof of Work**: Implement proof of work to ensure consensus by finding a nonce that satisfies the difficulty criteria.
4. **Execution**: Download the JWT blocks via torrent, decode them, and execute the instructions on the VM.

This approach ensures decentralized distribution and secure execution of smart contracts with consensus through proof of work. If you have further questions or need additional details, feel free to ask!
